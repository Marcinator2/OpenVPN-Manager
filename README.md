OpenVPN Manager is a local Windows desktop application for managing
locations, routers, OpenVPN certificates, server configuration, exports, and
live connection status. It is published by the unregistered **mb-soft** project.

German illustrated user guide: [PDF](docs/OpenVPN-Manager-Anleitung-DE.pdf) ·
[Word](docs/OpenVPN-Manager-Anleitung-DE.docx). Includes instructions for adding
locations and routers later while keeping the existing PKI.

## Features

- Manage locations and up to ten routers per location.
- Calculate VPN and LAN addressing from protected internal location IDs.
- Show device IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways in the list.
- Export all router rows to XLSX with localized headers and Excel filters.
- Create a CA, server material, and passwordless router client certificates.
- Generate server configuration, CCD files, and client profiles.
- Preview exports with private material redacted.
- Compare and explicitly install the complete server configuration.
- Monitor OpenVPN and display live router connection information.
- Use English or German UI text and light or dark themes.
- Check for stable releases and install verified updates after confirmation.

## Display terms

Open **Settings > Display terms** to customize the singular and plural names for
locations, VPN routers, and connected devices. English and German have separate
fields; editing one language does not switch the application language. Empty
fields use the general defaults. Terms may contain up to 40 Unicode characters,
including spaces, but no control characters.

The preview updates as you type. **Apply** saves the terms and refreshes the UI
without changing selection or certificate/configuration state. **Cancel** discards
the draft. **Restore defaults** clears only the language currently being edited;
apply the draft to save that reset. Terms also appear in Excel headers.

New router identities always use `<location identifier>_Router<number>`, for
example `0004_Router1`. Display terms and language changes never rename these
identities, certificate files, or VPN profiles. Previous test data is not migrated
or deleted automatically. The network addressing model remains unchanged.

## Requirements

- Windows Server 2022 or a compatible modern Windows version
- Python 3.14 for development
- OpenVPN 2.7.x and Easy-RSA 3.2.x for certificate and server operations
- Administrator rights for protected PKI, installation, ACL, and service work

The application discovers OpenVPN service paths from the Windows registry and
uses standard installation paths only as fallbacks.

## Download and verification

Tagged releases provide an unsigned Windows x64 ZIP and a SHA-256 checksum.
Windows SmartScreen may warn because the executable is not currently
code-signed.

```powershell
$archive = Get-Item .\OpenVPNManager-v*-windows-x64.zip
Get-FileHash $archive -Algorithm SHA256
Get-Content "$archive.sha256"
```

The hashes must match exactly. Release archives never contain a database,
settings, certificates, keys, exported profiles, or other runtime data.

## Application updates

Packaged stable releases check GitHub once after startup. Use **Updates > Check
for updates** to check again. **Update now** downloads the newer stable release,
verifies its SHA-256 checksum and archive layout, tests startup without opening
user data, then closes and restarts the application. **Later** leaves the
installed version unchanged. Downloads and preparation can be cancelled.
Develop pre-releases and source builds do not install or automatically check
for updates. Versions without an updater need one manual upgrade first.
Pre-rename Mango VPN Manager builds also require one manual installation of an
OpenVPN Manager release because their updater expects the former executable and
archive names.

The updater replaces only `OpenVPNManager.exe`, `_internal/`, and
`OpenVPNUpdater.exe`. It preserves `data/`, settings, databases, PKI, exports,
and other files outside those managed program entries. It never controls
OpenVPN services. Close other application instances before updating. If the
installation folder is protected, restart the application as administrator;
the updater does not request elevation itself. Preparation requires approximately
3 GiB plus the download size of free space. ZIP downloads are limited to
512 MiB and extracted packages to 1.5 GiB.

Updates use the public GitHub release feed without credentials. The release
workflow verifies that stable tags belong to `main`. HTTPS and SHA-256 protect
transport and download integrity; the binaries remain unsigned and the checksum
is not an independent publisher signature.

### Recovery

The updater records its transaction under `.openvpn-manager-update/` and retains the last
program backup under `.openvpn-manager-update/<transaction-id>/backup/`. Replacement
failures restore the previous program files. Interrupted replacements are
recovered before the next normal startup opens the database.

If an interruption left the EXE or its runtime temporarily unavailable, close
all instances and run the standalone helper from the installation directory:

```powershell
.\OpenVPNUpdater.exe --recover (Get-Location).Path
```

If that helper is also missing, run the copy in the transaction's `backup/`
directory with `--recover` and the absolute installation directory. The helper
copies itself outside the installation before restoring files. Do not delete
the transaction directory until recovery succeeds.

The latest backup also permits manual restoration of the three managed program
entries after a later startup problem. Close the application first and retain
the failed program files separately. Never replace or merge `data/` as part of
program recovery. Recovery does not undo database changes made by a later
application version; future schema changes must account for that compatibility
boundary.

## Development setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Marcinator2/OpenVPN-Manager.git
cd OpenVPN-Manager
.\build.ps1 -Start
```

The script checks Python 3.14, creates a missing `.venv`, installs development
dependencies, and runs pip check. Install Python 3.14 with the Python launcher
first. Existing invalid environments are reported without replacing them.
`-Start` runs from source instead of building the EXE; omit it to build.
Do not combine `-Start` with `-Clean` or `-StagingOnly`. Environment activation is not required.

Source execution stores SQLite data and settings under the local `data/`
directory. Packaged execution uses `data/` beside the EXE. Both are ignored.
New installations use `data/openvpn_manager.db` and
`C:\ProgramData\OpenVPNManager\pki`. Data from a pre-rename development copy
must be migrated manually: place the database in the new `data/` directory,
rename it to `openvpn_manager.db`, move the PKI to the new ProgramData path,
and update `pki_path` in a copied `settings.json`. The application never copies
or merges databases or PKI material automatically.

## Tests and Windows build

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
.\build.ps1
.\scripts\assert-release-safe.ps1 -ApplicationDirectory .\dist\OpenVPNManager
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\smoke_update.py dist\OpenVPNManager
```

CI may pass an already provisioned interpreter explicitly with
`-PythonExecutable`; local builds default to `.venv`. Stable release CI passes
`-ReleaseVersion vX.Y.Z`; builds without this parameter are development builds.
The embedded identity includes version, build type, and source commit.

Use `-StagingOnly` to build without replacing an existing packaged installation.
Its output is `build/package-staging/OpenVPNManager`; pass that directory to
the safety check and smoke test instead. The smoke test uses temporary program
copies and synthetic data, tests the real helper, and cleans up its own test
processes and files. It does not download a release or use the live PKI.

The build script preserves an existing packaged `data/` directory. The safety
check therefore intentionally rejects a local release folder containing data.

## Security model

- Existing certificates, keys, configurations, and exports are never silently
  overwritten.
- Productive system changes require explicit confirmation.
- PKI resets move the PKI to a timestamped backup instead of deleting it.
- Client private keys and TLS static keys are redacted from previews.
- Exports containing private keys require an additional confirmation.
- OpenVPN receives access only to required server runtime material; client keys
  and the CA private key remain protected.
- Service restarts are always separately confirmed.

Never attach real databases, settings, certificates, keys, profiles, status
files, or exports to an issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Addressing model

- VPN address: `10.8.<internal ID>.<router number>`
- Router LAN: `10.<internal ID>.<router number>.0/24`
- Router LAN IP: `10.<internal ID>.<router number>.1`
- Device IP: `10.<internal ID>.<router number>.<100 + router number>`
- Device subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
- Device gateway: the Router LAN IP (`10.<internal ID>.<router number>.1`)

The VPN pool is `10.8.0.0/16`; internal location ID `8` is reserved to prevent
overlap with Router LAN networks.

## Contributing and releases

Development happens on `develop`; release-ready changes reach `main` through a
pull request. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md),
and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

To publish a stable release, open **Actions > Release > Run workflow**, select
**main**, and enter the new version (for example `v0.2.0` or `0.2.0`).
Leave **Publish the stable release** enabled to publish, or disable it for a
build-only test. Version numbers are chosen by the maintainer, not incremented
automatically. A merge to `main` alone does not publish anything.

The workflow scans the complete history, tests, builds, runs the packaged
updater smoke test, and checks package contents. Only after those checks pass
does it create the annotated tag on the exact tested commit and publish the
ZIP and checksum as the latest stable release. The same normalized `vX.Y.Z`
identity appears in the tag, release, archive name, and application. Both modes
retain downloadable ZIP/checksum artifacts for 14 days.

Versions must be newer than existing stable tags. Existing releases (including
drafts) are never overwritten, and a tag pointing to another commit is refused.
If publication fails after creating a tag, rerun the same version on the same
Main commit while no release exists; otherwise resolve the failed publication
before retrying. Never move or delete a published tag.

Manually pushing a new stable tag still starts the Release workflow. Keep the
workflow on the default branch (`main`) so GitHub displays the manual start
button. Manual runs on branches other than `main` are rejected.
The workflow creates the tag and release in the same run; it does not rely on
a tag created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` triggering another workflow.

To publish a development build, open **Actions > Develop Build > Run workflow**,
select **develop**, leave **Publish a GitHub pre-release** enabled, and start the
workflow. It scans the complete history for secrets, runs tests, builds Windows
binaries, and checks the package for private or runtime data before publishing.
Each run uses a unique `develop-<run ID>-<attempt>` tag on the exact tested commit
and attaches a ZIP and SHA-256 checksum. It is marked as a pre-release and does
not replace the latest stable release.

Disable the publish checkbox for a build-only test. Both modes also provide
downloadable workflow artifacts for 14 days. Only runs targeting `develop` are
accepted. The workflow must remain on the repository's default branch (`main`)
for the manual run button to be available; select `develop` when starting it.
